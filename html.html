        <p2>Link, the hero of Hyrule is the main character in the video game franchise, the Legend of Zelda.
    
     He has been reincarnated many times to combat evil forces that try to destroy the kingdom of Hyrule.
    
     Many people who glance over these games may think that Zelda, is the main character but that is not the case.
    
    Zelda is almost always a princess that Link is trying to save in pretty much every one of their games.
